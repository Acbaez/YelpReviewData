COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice Final Project

Introduction and Background:

Yelp is a mobile app and desktop website that allows users to view restaurants and services based on ratings, location, and price. Users can also see pictures of food, menu, and the general space. In addition, users can leave reviews on Yelp to help other users decide on using that particular service/restaurant. For users that Yelp deems as “cultural ambassadors” to a city, they receive the title of “Elite.” For this project, we are focusing on how “Elite” members of Yelp leave reviews.
From personal experience using Yelp, we have noticed that users tend to leave more opinionated reviews as they gain more experience reviewing restaurants. Through this observation, we became curious if users leave more “critical” reviews if they are Elite members. The question became more relevant to us after seeing how Yelp has made its data publicly available for student projects, guaranteeing that we would have a quality dataset to work with. In the context of this project, we define the word “critical” as users leaving more reviews with a negative connotation. With this background, we formed the following research question and hypothesis. 

Research Question:
Are Yelp users more critical in their reviews when they have an “Elite” title verses when they don’t?

Hypothesis:
When a user is an Elite member, their reviews will be more critical compared to when they are not an Elite member.

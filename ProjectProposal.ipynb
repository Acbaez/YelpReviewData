    "Our question we are researching is if Yelp users become more critical in their reviews after they become Elite members of Yelp. The results might mean that people change or do not change the way they review after gaining the status of Elite members. This fits into what is already known because we have noticed that Elite members tend to leave more critical reviews but we want to prove this statement with actual data. Some problems we may encounter would be deciding what to count as critical or not. Another problem we may encounter is that the users may have left critical reviews from the beginning and there is not a difference in critical reviews after they become Elite members. Furthermore, another possible problem is that we find a correlation between a user having more critical reviews after being an Elite member but it is not due to the change in status but from other factors we are not measuring. \n",
    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, this finding will reveal that a change in status to Elite member can alter the way a user leaves reviews. If our methods don’t work and our hypotheses are wrong, we will know that there was no correlation in users leaving more critical reviews after they become Elite members. We would also reveal that our method and/or hypotheses are wrong, and provide an alternative way to approach the problem to someone who would study this problem in the future.\n"

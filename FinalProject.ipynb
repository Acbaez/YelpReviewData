    "# 1. Introduction and Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp is a mobile app and desktop website that allows users to view restaurants and services based on ratings, location, and price. Users can also see pictures of food, menu, and the general space. In addition, users can leave reviews on Yelp to help other users decide on using that particular service/restaurant. For users that Yelp deems as “cultural ambassadors” to a city, they receive the title of “Elite.” For this project, we are focusing on how “Elite” members of Yelp leave reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "From personal experience using Yelp, we have noticed that users tend to leave more opinionated reviews as they gain more experience reviewing restaurants. Through this observation, we became curious if users leave more “critical” reviews if they are Elite members. The question became more relevant to us after seeing how Yelp has made its data publicly available for student projects, guaranteeing that we would have a quality dataset to work with. In the context of this project, we define the word “critical” as users leaving more reviews with a negative connotation. With this background, we formed the following research question and hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:** Are Yelp users more critical in their reviews when they have an “Elite” title verses when they don’t?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**  When a user is an Elite member, their reviews will be more critical compared to when they are not an Elite member."

The only privacy concerns or terms of use are that if the project were to be published, our project is not able to disclose the contents of the dataset. In terms of biases, our data was taken from two countries and ten metropolitan areas, so our dataset is pretty diverse, and not exclude certain populations. As for issues, since our dataset includes yelp users who have reviewed locations within the ten metropolitan cities, if someone were to obtain our data, they could identify someone’s user ID and first name, and be able to track multiple locations that a person has frequented within a city. To prevent this issue, we dropped the columns that included the first name of the yelp reviewers and their locations within our dataset.\n"

    "\n",
    "After visualizing and analyzing our data, we conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a relationship between Elite status and sentiment. As such, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two variables in question. Our initial intuition that being an Elite member would correlate with leaving more critical reviews was not statistically significant because the likelihood of observing a coefficient of -0.0797 when there is in fact no relationship between Elite status and sentiment is higher than our alpha level of .05. Furthermore, the distribution of sentiments among Elite reviews and non Elite reviews from the users analyzed are very similar, meaning that the “Elite” status can not be used as an indicator of writing more critical reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the data we used and the processes we did not complete, there are several confounds in our work. In our methods, we analyzed all Yelp users who have ever been Elite and compared their reviews from before they were Elite and after they were Elite. We did not analyze the broader set of Yelp users who have never been given the Elite title. Because of this, it may be that users who were given the Elite title at one point tend to give more critical reviews than other Yelp reviewers. Furthermore, the Yelp academic dataset that we pulled our two datasets from does not include user data from all the countrie Yelp is available, meaning that there may be relevant Elite data that we could have analyzed, but did not have access to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, our team can compare users who have been given the Elite title at some point to the broader pool of Yelp users and their reviews. This will allow us to solidify our conclusion that the Elite title does correlate with the sentiment of a review. Similarly, we can analyze the sentiment of the “average” Yelp review for a geographical region or area which may provide valuable information to businesses which rely on Yelp to bring in new customers. \n"
